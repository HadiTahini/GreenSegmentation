# GreenSegmentation

### At Bilberry, pictures taken from our cameras are used to recognize some plant species. Some of the AI algorithms mainly detect them thanks to their green color on a brown background.

### This software program will allow us to input RGB picture and it will be transformed into black and white picture(the green pixels will turn black and the other colors will turn white).
